"Previously, I defined DH as an umbrella term for something like the use of technology to study human cultures and the study of the effects of digital technology on human cultures. Today, I would add that DH has (or should have) a self-conscious reflection on the technical aspects of these endeavours, whether that means acquiring and making use of the programming skills to produce new tools for digital study of human culture, examining the methodological problems of using these tools, or theorising the way their underlying technologies affect human society and the material objects of human culture. That said, I am worried that the theorising of the Digital Humanities, the development of infrastructure to support the Digital Humanities, and the opportunity of exploiting the big data sphere of the internet are collectively having the effect of marginalising the study of traditional objects of study in the Humanities, particularly those of the more distant past.","Scott Kleinman","2012-01-01"

"As I said on my blog: Digital Humanities is the discipline born from the intersection between humanities scholarship and computational technologies. It aims at investigating how digital methodologies can be used to enhance research in disciplines such a History, Literature, Languages, Art History, Music, Cultural Studies and many others. Digital Humanities holds a very strong practical component as it includes the concrete creation of digital resources for the study of specific disciplines.","Elena Pierazzo","2012-01-01"
"Digital Humanities mean, to me, more now than it did back in 2009 when I first did the Day of DH. DH offers a set of tools to pose humanistic inquiry, but it doesn't necessarily offer definitive answers to those questions. Instead it celebrates and records a process of intellectual pursuit that is then distributed and disseminated to the Humanities community and abroad. Engaging in Digital Humanities is also an ethos: collaboration, building knowledge, sharing projects, screwing around. I apply this to my scholarship as well as my teaching. If my work is better, more complex, because of Digital Humanities, so too will my students' work benefit from the tools, state of mind, and ethos.","Katherine D. Harris","2012-01-01"

"I view the Digital Humanities as a constantly changing field, which escapes easy definition - this is has benefits but also presents challenges! Standard definitions talk about the application of information technology to humanities teaching and research - whether that be to develop better ways of doing things or to create new questions and paradigms - but I think that the field also has a key role in articulating how technology is changing scholarship.","Paul Spence","2012-01-01"
"Digital Humanities is the combination of using digital techniques to better understand and present our understanding of the Humanities. It is about the dissemination of our work, the sharing of knowledge and collaborating to give the best possible chance to a project. Digital Humanities is about the Community, about learning, constantly evolving and being open to new ways of thinking about old questions. It is not, as a friend asked, about building digital humans.","Natasha Martin","2012-01-01"
"I would define Digital Humanities as a term used to identify persons, practices, ideologies, etc., that conform to institutional and scholarly values as determined by individual and institutional norms. But I would distinguish the definition of DH from doing digital humanities work (theoretical, practical, critical), which means something much more. Doing digital humanities means challenging the institutionalization of humanistic inquiry; in fact, it means responding to the crippling institutionalization of emotive responses to humanistic practices within the public sphere of all “knowledge workers.” To do this means that we must build tools, technologies, methodologies, and theories that represent this disruptive force, but we must also put what we build into practice. It is not longer enough to present (or represent) an idea, a tool; we must do the work of the community and we must engage the community in developing the ways in which we make our (our as in humanity) work accessible (this means disability studies needs to become a stronger focus of our scholarship and our practices). We must, as Alan Liu argued practice being the service community that we have always wanted to become.","Shawn W. Moore","2012-01-01"
"I think I said last year that I dislike that question, and that remains the case. Its boundaries are continually shifting and elude satisfactory definition.

"What it really comes down to is what are people doing to contribute to an understanding of the digital age or what are they doing to expand the practices and work of humanities fields using current technology. A person is not a Digital Humanist by mistake. They are not a Digital Humanist simply because they use a computer to do their work nor are they a Digital Humanist simply by virtue of working in a humanities field and being able to program. What is the methodological framework for their work? For example, using JuXta for collation on a new edition of a novel for the sake of efficiency does not make that edition a DH project, but writing about how the use of JuXta changes the way that we create scholarly editions of literature would fall into the DH field. Essentially, whether or not a person is trying to engage with DH, whether in theory or in practice, determines whether or not they are a Digital Humanist.","tesshab","2012-01-01"

"Digital humanities is a scholarly enterprise which encompasses a field of study, a set of tools, a methodological approach, and a global community, among other things. Digital humanists examine the objects of humanistic study – literature, history, art, language and so forth – using digital tools to carry out the kind of analysis that would be very difficult or impossible to do without the use of technology. Where the value of digital humanities lies, however, is not in the powerful capabilities of the digital tools themselves – as impressive as these may be – but rather in the way that the analyses and visualizations produced by the technology are combined with the skills of critical interpretation, nuanced close analysis, and attentiveness to ambiguity which are born out of a deep grounding in so-called conventional humanities study.","Anouk Lang","2012-01-01"

"I have come to think about the digital humanities as an umbrella term for a few different things. These include the development of tools and software for research, teaching, and scholarship. In this case every part of the development process and use of these tools is potentially DH scholarship. I would also include the use of any digital tools and software for interpretation and analysis on humanities research questions. Beyond this I would include any work that involves challenging the traditional roles of scholarship and scholarly communication. For example, using blogs to communicate with broader audiences. Lastly, I would suggest that new media studies, that is studies of born digital objects is inherently a subset of work in the digital humanities. In short, any situation in which the idea of the digital touches or engages with work in the humanities.","Trevor Owens","2012-01-01"

"In the last 10 years I would have said something along these lines: As an experienced manager and ICT consultant my approach towards DH is practical. For me DH is about interconnecting researchers (and their collections), software developers and infrastructure providers. As a researcher my aim is different. Then DH is about bringing central questions about the nature of the humanities to light. But now I believe Digital Humanities is coming of age. And in my opinion Digital Humanities has become an intrinsic part of the Humanities. Therefore Digital Humanities is the same as the Humanities.","Douwe Zeldenrust","2012-01-01"
"To my mind, Digital Humanities is a two-pronged discipline: 1. Digital Humanists study the ways in which new technologies and new media impact on traditional humanities disciplines, on human interaction, society, and communication. 2.

"The phrase seems to say it for itself,'something related to the humanities going digital. That means anything within the realm of the humanities,'language, history, philosophy, literature, and the arts,'is fair game. In its most basic form, it is still transferring such topics into a digital medium, but more so for the purpose of uncovering or gaining some new information or perspective on the subject being presented. It could come in the form of visually condensing text in order to both give a general idea of the contents and to provide a quicker delivery of knowledge, or by laying out information in some other visual manner so that patterns can be used to quickly pick up on details that provide certain insight into the subject matter.","Iris","2012-01-01"

"Though I think 'Digital Humanities' can mean a wide range of things depending on who's defining it, I define it (usually in lowercase) as an area of study that focuses on the intersection of technology and humanistic research. That's the bare bones of it. But really, in practice (or in Praxis, in my case, as in the Praxis Program at UVa - get it?), DH is a wild, carefree romp through the worlds of coding, design, project management, data analysis, and much more, in order to rethink and reappropriate traditional methodologies of humanities scholarship and research.","Brooke Lockwood Lestock","2012-01-01"
"While I endorse all the work done under the rubric of Digital Humanities, I am actually not a fan of the term. I feel that the term is used to define a political move within academia that is focused on the privileging of certain technologies and technological approaches over the greater epistemological questions that define the humanities and its constituent disciplines. As someone who has to work with people who may be wary of digital technology in their teaching, research, and publishing practice, I find that insinuating that 'digital humanities' is in some way essentially different from general humanities alienates the unfamiliar and more deeply entrenches the already conservative. I believe that an approach that considers the incorporation of these technologies as part of a continuum in the ongoing impact of technology on academic work that predates the digital and not as a political paradigmatic shift better reminds us that scholarship is centrally focused on the answering of questions about the unknown with whatever tools are at our disposal. The digital shouldn't really matter in the name and we should think about incorporating this approach to scholarship across all work and not a subset of research. The work is good and important, the term I find more problematic and rarely if ever use to define my work or the work we do at my institution.","Kimon Keramidas","2012-01-01"

"Digital humanities is just one method for conducting humanistic inquiry. Doing research in the humanities often boils down to finding a pattern--in a single text or across several texts--and then providing an interpretation of that pattern. In digital humanities, computation is used to assist in pattern recognition, pulling out patterns that would be difficult for humans to find unassisted. Interpretation of that pattern, however, remains the most important part of the process.","Brian Croxall","2012-01-01"

"In a recent article on Inside Higher Ed., Steve Kolowich defines 'digital humanities' as 'a branch of scholarship that takes the computational rigor that has long undergirded the sciences and applies it to the study of history, language, art and culture.' To this (and other definitions of digital humanities), I would add that the digital humanities must also consider the interface between digital and analog culture, between the pixels of our computer screens and the printed text of bound books. What we do online has little meaning if it isn't linked (literally or figuratively) to embodied practice. What we are online only exists insofar as it is connected to what we are in the flesh.","Jesse Stommel","2012-01-01"
"Digital Humanities, as I have understood it this semester, is the idea or goal in the process of creating something new. I would define Digital Humanities as the idea of integrating and analyzing technical/computational material and create activities with humanistic studies. Basically, it's understanding the material deeper. One activity we did for example this semester was reading the stories of Sherlock Holmes. To understand the story better, with DH we used a tool called the Voyant website. On there, we were able to explore more of the stories depth such as discovering which words are used more than others, also creating charts and graphs and etc.. We were also fortunate to watch the TV series 'Sherlock' to understand the story and actual characters a bit more. Another activity was when reading the novel 'Ms. Dalloway,' which consists of text on paper, with D; we did a mapping project of each of the character's main movements and sightseeing. It made it seem as if we could actually see where they went every day in real life using Google earth. Basically, I would say digital humanities is the process of going further within the research to find that hidden quality that you couldn't see on the surface and create something new with it.","Lexie","2012-01-01"

The merging of Literature, Media Arts and other schools of storytelling and criticism into an emergent network that benefits from history but lacks the downside and fixed ideas of entrenched interests be it in the classroom, the boardroom or copyright office. This is an attempt to cast a wider net to include social media and the democratization of media production into the literary cannon complete with thoughtful and insightful analysis and scholarly study and reportage. Literature department walls become osmotic membranes and connecting tissue between liberal arts scholarship in academia, art, technology and social media content producers. DH is a conceptual location where good ideas, best practices and innovation is encouraged. Transdisciplinarity is the new DH Norm. DH is a network aggregate university.

"I view the digital humanities as a collaborative, open, and emerging field of inquiry. A state of mind, a methodology, and theoretical approach to knowledge, I embrace how it forces us to reconceive our practice. In my own work, I embrace curation, as a means of reweaving and reintegrating theory and practice in history. I seek to interpret space, place, and identity in a multi-sensory way. I fail more often than not. But the digital humanities is like jazz in that it is about process, as well as out outcome.","Mark Tebeau","2011-01-01"
"My definition of Digital Humanities is the creative analysis, synthesis and presentation of information (both print and non-print) in digital environment. Digital humanities investigate how digital media affect the disciplines in which they are used. In practice, we are constantly redefining not only the concept of humanities computing but also of computing itself. In this manner, we come to understand how these disciplines when recalibrated for a digital environment contribute to our knowledge of computing; we also come to understand how computing changes the way we acquire knowledge and experience affect.","Theodoros Chiotis","2011-01-01"

"Digital Humanities is the informed and intentional use of digital objects and practices to create and study in the humanities, broadly defined. In that sense, it is a specialization that cuts across disciplinary boundaries to the work of digital humanists in other disciplines. It is also the insistence that the humanities comes to understand the implications of its assumption that only print technologies exist, and it is the insistence that the humanities learns that no technology is invisible, natural, or inevitable, and that someday all humanists will be digital. A few will specialize in print, chirographic or oral-culture humanities.","Sharon Cogdill","2011-01-01"
"I think digital humanities, like social media, is an idea that will increasingly become invisible as new methods and platforms move from being widely used to being ubiquitous. For now, digital humanities defines the overlap between humanities research and digital tools. But the humanities are the study of cultural life, and our cultural life will soon be inextricably bound up with digital media.","Ed Finn","2011-01-01"
"For me, 'DH' is an umbrella term for some recent trends in the humanities: amongst others collaborative working and writing, data driven research and visualization. Very often the current discussions on DH are discussions of delimitations and demarcations. One of the main questions is - imho - if DH should be either an integrated part of the humanities or else be some kind of an auxiliary discipline (in the field of History, in German we have the expression 'Historische Hilfswissenschaften').","Peter Haber","2011-01-01"
"Digital Humanities involves the effort to consider how our human capabilities and capacities are developing, or being challenged, by and through digital media.  Those scholars and practitioners who locate themselves within digital humanities view themselves as interdisciplinary collaborators who want to work together to enhance opportunities for individuals and groups traditionally marginalized from the centers of power. We therefore see our task as a critical and productive one, pressing back against the tides of efficiency and busyness that are leading people to view themselves merely as earners and consumers rather than as human creators and participants.","Lynn Schofield Clark","2011-01-01"
"I don't know that defining digital humanities has any useful purpose, though the act of defining marks digital humanities with the attribute of scholarly inquiry. A humanist with an interest in digital things is, I hope, still a humanist, one who defines the self by interest in varieties of human expression. If one's interest is digital things, then one must achieve some form of digital literacy to do useful scholarly things. If one's interest is humanities, one must think about how digital technology reshapes one's interaction with traditional---and new---objects of humanist studies.","Wesley Raabe","2011-01-01"

"The advent of digital technologies is changing and challenging the ways historians practice their craft. The way we collect, present, and store information has changed rapidly in the last twenty years. Digital history is several things: a methodology meant to aid the traditional art and practice of historians, the use of digital tools to gain insight into information that cannot be done with a legal pad and pen, allows historians to disseminate and present their information in new ways, and a means to reach wide audiences through digital technologies. The goal isn’t cliometrics 2.0 or to augment the theory-driven social sciences, but to abide by the historian's commitment to complexity and nuance while utilizing digital technologies to aid that task.","Jason Heppler","2011-01-01"
"Humanities is humanities, digital or not -- the study of literature, fine arts, history, language, and philosophy.  We don't distinguish digital sociology or digital astronomy, so why digital humanities?  Just because computers are involved doesn't mean the basic nature of the subject area is any different than it has been been traditionally.   Computers allow for doing things with texts and other cultural artifacts that could not be done feasibly without the computational power and storage modern computers provide.

"The digital humanities, quite simply, is doing humanities work with digital media. Though much has been made about digital media, like video games, threatening the kind of book learning that humanists do, many of the same critical problems and questions we have been working on for centuries still apply and can be used to read these new media forms. Furthermore, these digital tools can be leveraged to help us do this kind of intellectual labor. So digital humanities includes both doing humanities on digital objects and using digital objects to do humanities.","Timothy Welsh","2011-01-01"
"DH is all about freedom.  Humanity is the producing animal (Marx) or the symbol-using animal (Kenneth Burke).   The humanities have always studied what people create in the realm of freedom.

"Digital Humanities is the deliberate, critical application of emerging technology to the study of traditional subjects such as literature, art, philosophy, and language, often (but not always) with a focus on how those traditional fields are now using emerging technology. We are deliberate and critical when we foreground the study of our own digital tools (for example, the forward-thinking digital humanist prefers the open-source tool to the proprietary one).

One could easily send a message to one or multiple recipients just from his email account, posting on a blog or simply from his Facebook account (posting a Wall status update). The users around the world are all interconnected together and regardless if one chose to send a message from his yahoo account to an AOL one that is totally possible as now all the separated networks (e.g. AOL, Yahoo) are connected under one umbrella: The Internet. Before, one AOL user was able to send a message just to the members from his network (AOL). Today, the technical developments made possible that everybody could be connected in real time, to anyone else. The information in electronic form can be transmitted not just to those proficient in computing science but also to those interested in modem languages, law, or arts.

We are aware that some DH projects can ovelap with digital libraries or teaching aids and digital learning objects.","Isabel Galina","2011-01-01"

"I define digital humanities, loosely, as the use of computers and the Internet to advance research, teaching, and scholarly communication in the humanities, as well the study of computing's significance for the humanities. Many activities would fall under this definition, including building tools and collections, using tools and collections to discern patterns in humanities data, communicating the results of humanities research through multimodal and/or interactive publications, linking together classes using social networking technologies, and analyzing the significance of networked culture. I also define digital humanities by its community and its ethos, which I view as being committed to openness, experimentation, collegiality, transdisciplinarity, public knowledge, and innovation.","Lisa Spiro","2011-01-01"
"The Digital Humanities are  – or should be – a movement in the Humanities that aims to design, develop, promote, and use digital tools to support work – academic or not – in the various disciplines of the Humanities.

I hope that these practices will soon be so natural to the Humanities that they won’t need to be qualified Digital anymore.","Segolene Tarte","2011-01-01"
"I define Digital Humanities as a praxis and also as a field, and in this way it reminds me of Romanticism, also a praxis and a field in my opinion. As a practice, DH involves making and/or thinking about digital objects or entities that participate in or contribute to Humanities disciplines. As a field, it perhaps includes the growing body of electronic literary texts (either e-born or book-born) and archival projects as well as theory and criticism related to digital technologies.

"The digital humanities is what digital humanists do.  What digital humanists do depends largely on academic discipline but also on level of technical expertise.  Each discipline, with varying degrees of intensity, has over the years developed a set of favored methods, tools, and interests that, although shared with other disciplines, remains connected to the discipline.  The task of the digital humanities, as a trans-curricular practice, is to bring these practitioners into communication with each other, and to cultivate a discourse that captures the shared praxis of bringing technologies of representation, computation, and communication to bear on the work of interpretation that defines the humanities.","Rafael Alvarado","2011-01-01"

"The digital era is being born from the change of the support itself in the Human Sciences thought, with the transformation of our relationship to textuality. This digital turn happens in the context of a crisis in the Human sciences, first a financial crises, but also an institutional and politic one, even if it is softer in Switzerland. In this context, the 'Humanités digitales' – a label diversely interpreted – offer the opportunity to think again our ways of building and transmitting knowledge. The DH are at the same time a practice and a problematic. They include not only the sum total of the digital technologies applied to the Human sciences, but eminently the questioning on the modifications provoked by these technologies, from the point of view of the training et of the knowledge transmission in the Human sciences.","Claire Clivaz","2011-01-01"

"For me, the digital humanities encompasses teaching and scholarship based around a commitment to building. Building doesn't necessarily mean coding. For me, building means understanding and critically analyzing how artifacts (writing, music, film, even houses, arguments, and groups of people) are put together, with the intention of being able to produce something out of the mass of objects and relations that make up our world.","Roger Whitson","2011-01-01"
"I think digital humanities is an unfortunate neologism, largely because the humanities itself is a problematic term. The biggest problem is that the tent isn't big enough! I have participated in a number of DH events and they are strikingly similar to things like Science Online.",,"2011-01-01"
"With that said, DH is at its best when it embraces the digital not simply as a means to the traditional ends of scholarship, but when it transforms the nature of what humanists do. The digital allows for scholars, librarians, archivists and curators to engage much more directly with each other and the public. Further, it allows them not simply to write for each other, but to build things for everyone.","Trevor Owens","2011-01-01"

My experience tells me that computing and technology has led to many new resources and even more answers to research questions.

Digital Humanities is a culture, a way of thinking, a new set of methods, and a new set of collaborations.","David Beavan","2011-01-01"
"Good question, to which there is no good answer, but rather just more questions. My own interpretation is quite broad, but there are two ways of seeing DH which interest me - one is generous and encompasses all work combining humanities research and digital tools and methodology etc, and the other would be rather narrower in definition, reflecting on the specific contribution which 'the digital' can make to humanities scholarship and on the 'new scholarship' which develops as a result.","Paul Spence","2010-01-01"
"A field of study that looks at the application of digital technology to the research areas of the humanities.  It is not necessarily undertaking that humanities research, but examining the methodology and provision of possibilities for enabling that research or new conceptions of related research. The majority of work in this area, however, gets characterised by those outside the field as IT professionals just doing a bit of programming work for them while uselessly banging on about long-term preservation formats, open data, and not really doing real research.","James Cummings","2010-01-01"
"In a world dominated by digital technology, DH is an attempt to let humanists catch up with the latest computing advances, understand them, criticize them, and eventually be able to determine their evolution 'from the inside'. In terms of a research program, though, DH is still largely undefined. We are still in the 'understanding and criticizing' phase, with only few people moving towards a truly 'creative' phase. We're pulled by the latest technologies developed within the other computing fields, hardly pushing back into these fields our own research results, for they are often perceived as too simplistic, or not generic enough.","Michele Pasin","2010-01-01"

Digital tools have and are breaking down the distinctions among those disciplines as well as between the traditional 'humanities' and other fields--the arts, for example. Digital tools are encouraging collaborative and open research. Digital tools are forcing us to rethink our definition of academic. Digital tools are re-defining 'scholar.' Digital tools may be pointing the way toward new ways of contemplation and contribution. The digital humanities is both a force for and a record of the ongoing changes.","William Allen","2010-01-01"

For my particular reasons, I define Digital Humanities as an attempt to use computing methods to understand 19th Century British literature from a book historians point of view. As a teacher, I use Digital Humanities to create a bridge among myself, my students and our contemporary culture. We use all kinds of tools to get into 19th Century print culture, and not just tools to assess the 19th Century moment but to also create content that can serve as a critique of our own use of tools, such as Twitter, Moodle, ClassSpot, tech-enhanced teaching facilities. For instance, we explore gaming as a way to discuss the technological upheaval of the printing press in the early 1900s. That's just a tidbit of my world as a Digital Humanist.","Katherine D.

But I am more sensitive now to the effects that method has on discipline in the first place, and how the distinction is not entirely stable.

The very activity of aggressively growing research in an open environment will doubtless change the definitions and limitations that former labels gave to us and our disciplines.","William Allen","2009-01-01"
"Digital Humanities is the marriage of two areas of study heretofore considered incompatible - IT and the humanities.  DH primarily involves the use of IT to gain new insights into the humanities.  The keywords are scale, navigation, and exchange.  These tools afford the humanist the ability to analyze large bodies of work on a previously unimagined scale.  They also allow for ease of research/data navigation and provide an efficient means of research/data exchange.  Secondarily, DH involves an analysis of the humanistic implications of information technology.","Paul Youngman","2009-01-01"
"Digital humanities attempts to bring humanistic inquiry and the artifacts of human experience into useful dialogue with digital technology.  It is, at once, a practical and a philosophical endeavor: a matter of building and of theorizing the built.  Practitioners are as likely to be adept at Java as they are post-structuralism; as drawn to the iPhone as they are to Moby Dick; as committed to a kind of optimistic futurism as they are deeply skeptical of a posthuman condition.  Digital humanities is also one of most exciting fields in the humanities today, with a burgeoning community of enthusiasts ranging from undergraduate students to senior scholars.","Stephen Ramsay","2009-01-01"

"Digital Humanities is any attempt to incorporate digital understandings or culture into scholarship, pedagogy and service.  For my particular reasons, I define Digital Humanities as an attempt to use computing methods to understand 19th Century British literature from a book historians point of view.  As a teacher, I use Digital Humanities to create a bridge among myself, my students and our contemporary culture.  We use all kinds of tools to get into 19th Century print culture, and not just tools to assess the 19th Century moment but to also create content that can serve as a critique of our own use of tools, such as Twitter, Moodle, ClassSpot, tech-enhanced teaching facilities.  For instance, we explore gaming as a way to discuss the technological upheaval of the printing press in the early 1900s.  That's just a tidbit of my world as a Digital Humanist.","Katherine D. Harris, San Jose State University","2009-01-01"
"I define humanities computing as the field of study that helps to provide insight into the human condition through digital technologies.  The methods and techniques used in the digital humanities can be varied: algorithms for emergent art, the application of procedural rhetorics to explore sociocultural issues, or the design and analysis of procedures to make computing technologies more human-friendly.  Research methods related to the digital humanities can be hermeneutic (e.g., what are the hidden cultural and social layers within technological practice, and what do they tell us about particular discourse communities?), ontological (e.g., how do I project my own beliefs, desires, and values onto a personal avatar?), or purely practical (e.g., how can I digitize this text to make it available and searchable to those audiences who do not have the means or ability to access a physical copy?) Humanities computing and the digital humanities are of vital importance as they keep technological systems human-centered, leaving room for creativity, exploration, and playfulness.  The famous interdisciplinary German thinker G. W. Leibniz pursued the dream of the Universal Computer as a means for freeing up the human mind for more creative and enjoyable pursuits; although information overload and the increased workload of distributed industries have made this goal quite challenging, I feel that the field of digital humanities does more to advance this philosophy of creative playfulness and exploration perhaps more than any other area of scholarly study.","Rudy McDaniel, University of Central Florida","2009-01-01"
"For me, the digital humanities is not a discipline per se, but a set of beliefs, theories, practices, methods, and artifacts associated with the use of digital technologies to support, extend, and transform traditional humanistic fields.  It cross-cuts the traditional humanities.  I follow Erwin Panofsky's definition of the humanities as those disciplines concerned with interpreting the 'records left by man.'  (Sexism not intended.)  Among the specific items in the assemblage of artifacts and ideas that currently characterize the field are (1) the use XML in a variety of forms, including TEI and serial RDF, to encode texts and data, and (2) the use of mathematical graph theory as a unifying language for describing texts, minds, and societies, and other organis(m|ation)s.","Rafael Alvarado, Dickinson College","2009-01-01"
"Humanist Computing is the application of computational methods and associated tools to address specific humanities research problems. Distinct from general computing approaches, Humanities Computing is embedded within the research concerns of the disciplines and sub-fields that make up the humanities. The methods employed in the field may be used to uncover new knowledge about corpora or to visualise research data in such a way as to uncover additional insights and meaning. Succinctly Humanities Computing is about structuring, analysing and communicating humanistic knowledge in a critical and authorial way using computing technology.","Craig Bellamy, King's College London","2009-01-01"

"For those us invested in literary studies and bibliophilism, digital humanities may seem like a contradictory and terrifying set of terms. Yet, the divide between the humanities and digital technologies seems to be increasingly blurred, thus rendering 'digital humanities' a complementary set of terms rather than a contradiction. Computing within the humanities is to utilize current computer technologies in the pursuit of literary studies. Digital humanities is the conjoining of different areas of disciplines in order to achieve a richer and more collaborative workspace; digital humanities signals the move towards interdisciplinary approaches within academia and the larger culture around us. E-pedagogy, social media classrooms, digital storytelling, blogs, etc. -- these are merely some examples in the current trend towards more interactive, collaborative, and interdisciplinary ways of learning that allows for a blurring of boundaries. Paving the way for dialogues to occur across different disciplines, digital humanities enables a kind of social utopia in which communication happens beyond the classroom, and even on a global scale. If the humanities concerns itself with the human condition and our place within this world (to put it broadly), it is imperative that humanists address the impact of digital technology on their subjects of inquiries. As English professor Cathy Davidson claimed in a 2009 Modern Language Association panel, this is not the age of digital technology: this is the age of humanists, and it is our tasks to forge and claim our positions as important thinkers and players within today's 'digital age.'","Viola Lasmana, San Francisco State University","2009-01-01"

"If you ask to an Italian, a Finnish or an American what HC is, would you get the same kind of answer? So my first answer is to start questioning the nature of your question. I think we need to start to apply the principles of ethnographic research to our field. Considering, for example, the existence of strong cultural differences. The universal language of the digital machine gave us the wrong impression that we all share the same values, methodologies, and approaches to the study of cultural objects. It is not so, and in fact I think there is a huge potential cultural danger in our current obsession with standardization. So my second answer would be that humanities computing is a semiotic oxymoron (pessimistic answer), but also a cultural challenge (optimistic option). Sometimes I ask myself: why HC did not do to humanities what cultural studies did to sociology, anthropology, or philosophy? Think of the profound impact that CS had on their intellectual agendas. My answer is that HC lacked an effective and self-confident cultural vision. This happened, in my opinion, beacause HC until now has been mainly focused on the document culture, and consequently has adopted an approach largely dependent on conservative (or if you prefer 'conservation') practices. The 'paradigm of conservation' is largely dominant in the international scenario, led by historically monolingual and monocultural institutions like TEI, which basically tells the community not just how to encode a text, but what a text is. It has been said by other colleagues that HC is the application of computational methods to humanities research and teaching. This definition is correct, but I think that future of HC would be not just to use and apply formal methods, but to challenge existing discourses, cultures and disciplines. So perhaps the issue would be not how much computing we need for getting the answers, but how much the computer science needs us to ask the right questions.","Domenico Fiormonte, Università Roma Tre","2009-01-01"
"For me, Humanities Computing means the transformation of creative and informative communication (for all individuals, not just academics, students and other experts) via an ever- and expanding array of information and communication technologies, an amplification of the individual's power to research, to write, to communicate, to publish and to participate in, and create new spaces in, the public sphere. Just as I feel that the Humanities enrich everyone's life, humanities transformed by ICTs enrich everyone's life.","Lesley Mary Smith, George Mason University","2009-01-01"

"I broadly define Humanities Computing/Digital Humanities as a field in which scholars within the humanities use or study computers or a digital environment (e.g. the WWW, video games, etc.) in their research.  I consider myself to be a digital humanities researcher because I am studying digital short fiction and its communities in my thesis, but also because I sometimes use social science methods and computing tools (online questionnaires, quantitative/qualitative analysis, etc.), which reflects the interdisciplinary nature of humanities computing.  Although I am currently completing a Ph.D. in English, my M.A. in Humanities Computing and Comparative Literature from the University of Alberta has helped me to approach my research from a more interdisciplinary perspective-- something that I see as being an integral part of humanities computing/digital humanities.","Susan Hesemeier, University of Toronto","2009-01-01"
"Digital humanities studies the intersection and mutual influence of humanities ideas and digital methods, with the goal of understanding how the use of digital technologies and approaches alters the practice and theory of humanities scholarship. In this sense it is concerned with studying the emergence of scholarly disciplines and communicative practices at a time when those are in flux, under the influence of rapid technological, institutional and cultural change. As a way of identifying digital interests and efforts within traditional humanities fields, the term “digital humanities” also identifies, in a general way, any kind of critical engagement with digital tools and methods in a humanities context. This includes the creation of digital editions and digital text or image collections, and the creation and use of digital tools for the investigation and analysis of humanities research materials.","Julia Flanders, Brown University","2009-01-01"
"I often say that humanities computing involves three distinct research areas. First, some researchers apply computing to research questions in the humanities. These might be questions they've always pursued but can now pursue faster or at a larger scale, or they may be questions that could not be addressed satisfactorily at all without computers. Second, some researchers take computing as an object of study using humanities methods. Examples include cyberculture and posthumanism. Third, some researchers take a generative approach, creating new online materials or tools for subsequent study and use. Most of my own work is in this third area.","Stan Ruecker, University of Alberta","2009-01-01"

In 2014-01-01 I am less convinced by the idea that what I described above is actually a distinct field of inquiry.

"Although I embrace the term digital humanities, I find the need to define digital humanities as something separate from or in addition to the humanities at large to be problematic. Even though the logic of print still shapes and governs aspects of what we do, both as humanists in the academy and our culture at large, electronic media have been shaping us and our culture for more than 100 years now and digital media for decades. The modern humanities, having their origins in the fifteenth century, were intimately tied to the new technology of the printing press: by the new ways of production, transmission, organization, visualization, and thinking that the printing press fostered. As humanists in the digital age, it should be a given for us to fully engage digital technologies and the new methods and apparatuses they foster. Simply put, there should be no need for us to identify ourselves as digital humanists.
But since we do need to do so, I define digital humanities not as doing the work of traditional humanities with digital technologies but as engaging the humanities with the tools available to us and by the logics they foster. We explore, we interpret, and we make. Most importantly, we understand that all technologies of representation and communication bring with them affordances and constraints, and to limit ourselves to the apparatus of one technology, of one technological age, is to limit what we and what the humanities can be.",John Walter,2014-01-01

Critical understandings related to this paradigm may include disassociation from any one particular tool and/or series of objects, the flexibility to merge and combine tools and conceptual frameworks to fit particular goals and/or participants, and the willingness to blend and combine legacy technologies with techniques not yet created.

Why define it? Just do it!,Simon Mahony,2014-01-01
"I define DH by my use of it. As I engage with DH, I am looking for ways to effectively communicate scholarly knowledge with a broader audience; not just as a way of outreach or dissemination, but as laying the foundation for the democratization of knowledge and incorporation of multivocality into scholarly work. Thus, a set of tools for effective engagement.",Sarah M. Rowe,2014-01-01
"Through my research and practice, I define DH as both the use and study of digital technologies.",Liza Potts,2014-01-01

"I stick by my 2011 definition: The Digital Humanities is both an evolving field with a discernable set of academic lineages, practices, and methodologies and a vague umbrella term used to describe the application of digital technology to traditional humanistic inquiry.
